# 🌴 The Wild Oasis — Hotel Booking Web App

> *“A digital resort for the data-hungry admin. Clean, calm, and coded to perfection.”*

**The Wild Oasis** is a **real-world hotel booking admin dashboard**, where full-stack web development meets operational excellence. It's built to manage bookings, cabins, guests, and revenue — all from a centralized, visually intuitive interface.

This project is a playground of modern React practices, offering a dark-themed, desktop-first experience that mirrors what you'd expect from a serious SaaS platform (minus the subscription fees).
